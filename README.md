# Nimbus Note Exporter

Nimbus Note recently removed the option (from their desktop clients) to bulk export your notes as HTML or PDF. This tool was created to bring that functionality back into the hands of the user.

> **Note:** This tool is in no way endorsed or affiliated with Nimbus Note or any of their subsidiaries. If you come across any issue while using this tool, you should create a bug report in this repository â€” NOT ON THEIR SUPPORT CHANNEL.

## Usage

### Installation

First make sure you have Node (v16+) & npm installed then run:

```
npm i -g nimbus-note-exporter
```

### Usage

After installation, you should have the `nimbus-note-exporter` in your PATH. There is nothing complex to it, just run:

```
nimbus-note-exporter
```

And you'll be prompted for your email & password. Your credentials are required for login to work.

> **Note:** You should not enter important credentials anywhere EXCEPT the official website. However, if you MUST then be CAREFUL and make sure your credentials aren't going anywhere you don't want.

## How it works?

This tool was created by reverse engineering Nimbus Note internal API used by their web clients. Expect this to break anytime.
