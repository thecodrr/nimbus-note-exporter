# Nimbus Note Exporter

Nimbus Note recently removed the option (from their desktop clients) to bulk export your notes as HTML or PDF. This tool was created to bring that functionality back into the hands of the user.

> **Note:** This tool is in no way endorsed or affiliated with Nimbus Note or any of their subsidiaries. If you come across any issue while using this tool, you should create a bug report in this repository â€” NOT ON THEIR SUPPORT CHANNEL.
> **Note 2:** I am not sure this tool comes under "legal" use of Nimbus Note internal APIs so if there's a complaint, I will have to take this down.

## Features

This tool supports exporting of the following data types from Nimbus Note:

1. Notes (including HTML content & metadata)
2. Folders
3. Attachments
4. Tags
5. Data across unlimited workspaces
6. Data across unlimited organizations

## Getting started

### Installation

First make sure you have Node (v16+) & npm installed then run:

```
npm i -g nimbus-note-exporter
```

### Usage

After installation, you should have the `nimbus-note-exporter` in your PATH. There is nothing complex to it, just run:

```
nimbus-note-exporter
```

And you'll be prompted for your email & password. Your credentials are required for login to work.

> **Note:** You should not enter important credentials anywhere EXCEPT the official website. However, if you are required to do so then be CAREFUL and make sure your login details are not going anywhere you don't want/intend.

After login, everything is automated. At the end you should have a `nimbus-export.zip` file in the directory where you ran the command.

## How it works?

This tool was created by reverse engineering Nimbus Note internal API used by their web clients. Expect this to break anytime.

## The output

This tool exports all your data from Nimbus Note in "raw" form as a .zip file with the following structure:

```
- <note_id>
    - assets
    - metadata.json
    - note.html
- <note_id>
    - assets
    - ...
```

### metadata.json

The `metadata.json` file contains information such as timestamps, tags, folders, & other metadata. Here's a complete list:

```ts
interface Metadata {
  globalId: string;
  parentId: string;
  rootParentId: string;
  createdAt?: number;
  dateAdded?: number;
  dateUpdated?: number;
  updatedAt?: number;
  type: string;
  role: string;

  outliner: boolean;
  emoji: string;
  is_portal_share: boolean;
  tags: string[];
  path: string;
  parents: string[];
  workspace: string;
}
```

### note.html

The `note.html` file is the raw content in HTML format.

### assets/

The `assets/` directory contains stuff such as fonts and attachments.
